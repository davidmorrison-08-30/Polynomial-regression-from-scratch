# Polynomial-regression-from-scratch

I've just completed building polynomial regression with gradient descent. The functions calculating r2_score and mean squared error are also coded from scratch. 

In the final part, I made and trained a model on <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/cases_deaths/new_cases.csv">covid-19 dataset</a> which is obtained from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus">Our World in Data</a>

The attached .csv file is significantly modified for the sake of interacting and preprocessing the data so it has only two columns: "date" and "World"
